/**Java isn't that strickt in what you shove into the if value. If you would replace 'credits > 0' with credits alone, this still
 * would work. So eventhough this would be evaluated to 12, when it's shoved into a conditional statement, JavaScript will then again
 * translate 12 to true. the same happenes if the credit variable is set to 0. JavaScript would then say 'no this is a falsy value', so
 * I'm going to translate that to false
 * So where you have learned about True and False before you now have to learn about
 * Truthy
 * Falsy
 * e.g.
 * If I would change credits > 0   into "yolo" JavaScript would see this as truthy, because he reads a string, and a string is truthy in the
 * condition. the same counts if you might put an array in that condition, JS will also see this as truthy

 * 0

 * null

 * NaN    Not a Number(rarely ever used)
 * These are the FALSY values in JavaScript
 * 
 * False, Null and undefined are the most common results in the developers world.
 * Null and undefined deserves a bit of more time, because a lot of developers are confused about these 2 and mix them together.
 * Let's look at the simularities:
 * they are both primitive data types that just like strings, number and booleans, and they're are also both ways to signalize emptyness.
 * However, on high leve, the core difference is that 
 * Null is how you as a developer signalize emptiness whereas  
 * undefined is where JavaScript signalizes emptiness
 * 
 * Let's say you are creating a live streaming app and you have current viewers, and that's set to NULL, meaning that null people are
 * watching the livestream at the moment. However a few minutes later a few viewers might popup
