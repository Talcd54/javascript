/**I don't understand why we need to write twice ${myLeads[i]}?
 * ChatGPT
 * In the renderLeads function, ${myLeads[i]} appears twice because it is used both as 
 * - the value of the href attribute in the <a> tag and 
 * - as the text content that will be displayed for the link itself.
 * The 1st  ${myLeads[i]} is inside the href attribute. This tells the browser where the link should go when clicked.
 * The value in myLeads[i] (which is a URL) is inserted as the destination of the link.
 * The 2nd  ${myLeads[i]} is between the opening and closing <a> tags. This sets the text that appears on the link.
 * In this case, it will display the URL from myLeads[i] as the clickable text on the web page
 * If you wanted to display a different text for the link, you could replace the second ${myLeads[i]} with something else.
 * For example, if you wanted the text to be "Visit Link" instead of showing the URL, you could change it to:
 * listItems += `
    <li>
        <a target='_blank' href='${myLeads[i]}'>
            Visit Link
        </a>
    </li>
`
In this case, the URL would still be the destination, but the link text would say "Visit Link."
