//adapt your html with 2 buttons. css is done already
//now let's make the button interactive
//write out in pseudo code what we need first
//1. we need to store the count somewhere and initialize as zero
//2. we need to kind of listen for a click on the button
//3. whent it's clicked, increment the count



//initialize the count as 0
//listen for clicks on the increment button
//increment the count variable when the button is clicked
//change the count-el in the HTML to reflect the new count

/*
//add an event listner in the html in thebutton
//create the function
function increment(){
    console.log("The button was clicked")

}
//info: for a console live preview select OUTPUT in the terminal and in the dropdown
//select 'Embedded Live Preview'. Then you will see the clicks messages
